- could make truncate(expand) write fewer bytes by adding an inode field
	'valid', where valid <= nbytes
- introduce offset typedefs: blockno_t, pgno_t, byteno_t, nbytes_t, ?
	typedef uint64_t blkno_t;  // BPRAM block number
	typedef uint64_t blkidx_t; // block index into a file
	typedef uint64_t byteno_t; // byte number

* benchmarks
- postmark
- untar
- rm
- something involving rename
- small, large appends, overwrites
- create large file
- well-respected benchmark (IOzone, FileBench (FSL port?))

* measurements
- compare SCSP to SP. and minimal? and ext2,ext3,ext4,btrfs?
- bytes written
  - measure actual writes
    - what code contributes how much to this measurement?
	- must the controller write an entire cache line? if so, measure this?
  - measure #bytes that change in file system image
- best, worst, and "expected" results
- number of epoch barriers?
- correctness
  - detect consistency
  - detect syscall atomicity
  - detect if file system does what it is supposed to (eg renames the file)

* limits
- SCSP write() can be atomic, but is it guaranteed? eg failed allocation part
  way through a large write? in general, how does abort work?
  perhaps there are two types of failures:
  - one write makes all the preceeding writes visible
    - easy to solve: log frees/allocs and reverse on failure
  - more than one live write (eg cmtime with write or rename)
    - is this ok for most apps? can we make it better? eg guarantee
      that if data is modified, the mtime was updated? or vice-versa.
    - can I turn these into single commits without much overhead?

* long term notes
- code seems too complicated. maybe how to commit is tied too closely to other?
- when SCSP has to COW, would it ever be helpful to wait on committing the change for a later write that would have to re-COW a shared set of blocks?
	- SP mode would do this
- can SCSP work with one crawl down and then back up?

* unimplemented write optimizations
- make truncate(expand) write fewer bytes by adding an inode field 'valid'
  where valid <= nbytes
- could not CoW unused inodes and dirent regions
  - do not CoW the entire dirent block(s) for rename (skip the ino field(s))
  - do not CoW unused and to-be-overwritten dirent entries for rename
  - do not CoW unused and to-be-overwritten inodes for rename
- only CoW indir block portions that will not be overwritten
- changing the height separately from the root addr is needless for append

* near term notes
- convince self that current code is correct.
- correctness test: snapshot ram before op, during op, and after: during should "match" before or after
	- want to snapshot during not during a machine instruction?
	- maybe track which bytes/pages change and only compare them for speed?
	- work with large file systems, too? (or, woozle has 8GB ram)
	- issue: syscalls are not "atomic". inode file grows in size, freed entries are modified, timestamp updates.
	- perhaps track in pin
- implement readdir() that works when called multiple times and contents change
- 64bit bpfs can create inos larger than 32b fuse can store. probably don't fix, just keep this in mind.
- fixme: commit_abort() does not abort entire syscall in SCSP
- do not allocate the first directory block when creating a directory?
- consider kernel_cache and *_timeout
- replace dcache bits for find_dirent() with persistent hashes in dirs?

* current work
- WC vs. WT for memory throughput benchmark
- explain bytes written differences
- move time updates to before modifications?
- optimize cows that are made (ie cow and then overwrite some blocks)
- add benchmarks and measurement tools
	- measure layout choices? e.g., to not store "..", no resource bitmaps, ...
	- postmark: run with smaller size of ram to bytes written ratio?
	- postmark: make runs deterministic
	- bonnie++: not deterministic, but variance seems <0.1%
	- build_apache: which app(s) make the small overwrites? could they be improved?
	- more macro/real-world benchmarks that involve durability
		- how should we evaluate disk sync costs? #bytes written.
		- mail delivery? (or, postfix suffices?)
		- dbt2
	- microbenchmark(s) for each syscall?
	- add macrobenchmarks: a good/respected one
		- truncate separate from unlink? write into a hole?
	- expand microbenchmark repetition to ~fill ext[34] journals?
	- use impressions?
- sort of feel that it is too much of a toy/not under realistic workloads.
	real workloads/hardware may make the performance benefits inconsequential
	or negative.
- is it ok to optimize only writes? (not reads or other aspects)
	- optimize runtime to make testing easier? to know it won't be a bottleneck?
		crawl_indir, crawl_tree_ref, crawl_inode
- should I prototype ENOSPC recovery?
- consider journaling
- could expand atomic writes to 16B: gcc -mcx16 and CMPXCHG16B

* possibly useful
- add more code documentation? (function definitions?) and/or clean up.
- make code fast in time, too, for ucsd?
