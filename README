BPFS - byte-addressable file system

* Requirements

For a correct system:
- 64-bit Linux (2.6 tested)
- FUSE >= 2.8

For development:
- 32/64-bit Linux (2.6 tested)
- FUSE >= 2.5

* Installation

$ make

* How to Use

BPFS can use a memory-mapped file/device or run in DRAM:
- File/device:
  1. (File) Create the file. E.g., dd if=/dev/zero of=bpram.img bs=1M count=$N
  2. Format the file system: ./mkfs.bpfs bpram.img
  3. Mount the file system: ./bpfs -f bpram.img /tmp/bpfs
- DRAM (no need to create a file and contents are lost at exit):
  1. ./bpfs -s $((N * 1024 * 1024)) /tmp/bpfs

There are several configuration macros at the top of bpfs.h and bpfs.c.

You can also profile BPFS's memory write traffic using the Pintool
bench/bpramcount.cpp. bench/bpramcount runs BPFS inside of Pin and
contains setup directions.
